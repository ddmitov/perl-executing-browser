# Perl Executing Browser - Thanks and Credits

Amata mea Argeia - gratiam magnam tibi ago!  
Patientia tua in studiis meis computatoriis auxilium meum maximum!  

Being in debt to each and every one,  
who prepared the official Perl and Qt documentation or  
shared useful knowledge on a variety of forums, blogs and other sites,  
I thank them all!  
Their expertise, effort and good are highly appreciated!  

Special thanks to the staff of the Library of the New Bulgarian University,  
where much of the initial development effort took place!

Special thanks to Stack Overflow users peppe, Piotr Dobrogost and Fèlix Galindo Allué.  
Their example code is no longer used in Perl Executing Browser,  
but their expertise and good will to help others are not forgotten!  

Thanks to Jennifer Maher-Bontrager, author of the Camel icon.

Thanks to Leon Anavi, Valentin Alexiev, Stefan Chekanov, Rangel Ivanov, Philip Georgiev,  
karaman, sisvenvet and all other members of Hackafe, the hackerspace of Plovdiv,  
for being welcoming host of the first public presentation of Perl Executing Browser  
on the 2nd of March 2014 and for their helpful proposals.  

Thanks to [probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd) for his  
knowledgeable instructions and patient cooperation  
in the preparation and testing of Perl Executing Browser AppImages!  
Perl Executing Browser currently can not be packed as an AppImage,  
but his knowledge and good will to help others are not forgotten!
